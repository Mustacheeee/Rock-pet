# Welcom to Rock Pets https://mustacheeee.github.io/Rock-pet/Page/index.html
Rock Pets is a whimsical and creative web project designed to spark your imagination and share the joy of having your very own virtual rock companion. While it may not provide actual rock adoptions, it offers a unique and entertaining experience that celebrates the idea of "adopting" a rock pet in a playful way.

## What is Rock Pets All About?

At Rock Pets, we celebrate the simple beauty of pet rocks. We believe that a rock can be a perfect pet, not because it can fetch a ball or roll over, but because it reminds us that love can give meaning to the simplest things.
## Project Status and Future Development

This project represents the web design concept of my Rock Pets website. While the website showcases the design and layout, many functionalities are not fully implemented at this stage. The primary purpose of this project is to provide a visual representation of how the website would look and feel.

### What's Working

- The website design and layout are complete, providing a clear visual representation of my concept.

### What's Not Working

- Several features and functionalities, such as user uploads, are not fully functional in this version.

### Future Development

In the next version of this project, I plan to introduce the following features:

1. **Dress Up Your Cyber Rock**: After users click "Adopt a Cyber Rock," they will be able to dress up their virtual rock pets. Once they finish dressing up their rock, the system will take a picture of the rock, and users will have the option to post it on the gallery.

2. **AI Rock Detection**: I aim to implement AI-based image recognition to detect whether the pictures users upload on the "Homeless Rock" page are indeed images of rocks. This feature will help ensure that the content posted is relevant to my rock-loving community.

Please stay tuned for updates on my project, and thank you for your interest in Rock Pets!
